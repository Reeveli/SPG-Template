!!!!!!Any and all scripts that automatically add editable objects for curators MUST BE DISABLED!!!!!!

Both editable units AND vehicles must be defined seperately!

MAGIC VARIBALE (must be defined locally for RZ): _unit setVariable ["RZ_allowed_edit", true,true];


Curator camera modes: BIS_fnc_setCuratorVisionModes defined in fn_post_player
Curator camera area restriction: addCuratorCameraArea in fn_post_player


It is reccomended NOT to use VCOM and to USE Lambs for optimal AI control

After respawn and/or other bugs use the ACE-selfinteraction to reset system

At the moment it is not possible to demote RZ back to a normal player/curator, except them fully leaving the server and reconnecting.
